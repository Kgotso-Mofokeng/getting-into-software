# My Journey into Software Development

This repository documents my step-by-step progress as I transition into software development.
Inspired by the [How to Get Into Software guide](https://github.com/npmaile/blog/blob/main/posts/2.%20How%20to%20get%20into%20software.md#how-to-get-into-software), 
I will be tackling challegnes, building projects, and sharing lessons learned along the way.
